// Just imagine that in this file, you can write a well-structured test with the following steps:
// 1. Fill in the username and password fields
// 2. Click on the "Access" button
// 3. Check if the login response is successful
// 4. If the response is OK, verify that the user token data is saved in memory
// 5. Ensure the login modal disappears, and the "Access" button is no longer visible
// 6. Depending on the business requirements, verify if the user is redirected to a dashboard or similar page
